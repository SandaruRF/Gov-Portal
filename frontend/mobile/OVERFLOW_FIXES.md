# KYC Verification Screen - Overflow Issues Fixed

## Problem
The KYC verification screen was experiencing RenderFlex overflow errors:
- "A RenderFlex overflowed by 27 pixels on the bottom"
- "A RenderFlex overflowed by 4.4 pixels on the bottom"

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Header Column Overflow**: The header's center Column with logo and text was too constrained
2. **Text Content Overflow**: Long subtitles in upload sections could overflow
3. **Fixed Height Container**: Header had insufficient height for content

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Header Layout Improvements
- **Increased header height**: Changed from `screenHeight * 0.14` to `screenHeight * 0.16`
- **Added padding**: Added `padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 8.0)` to center column
- **Reduced logo size**: Changed logo from 40x40 to 36x36 pixels
- **Reduced font size**: Changed "Gov Portal" text from 16px to 14px
- **Added mainAxisSize**: Set `MainAxisSize.min` to prevent expansion
- **Adjusted positioning**: Moved buttons from top: 20 to top: 16

### 2. Text Content Constraints
- **Added text overflow handling**: 
  - Title: `maxLines: 1, overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis`
  - Subtitle: `maxLines: 2, overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis`
- **Column sizing**: Added `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min` to text column

### 3. Layout Optimizations
- **Reduced spacing**: Changed SizedBox height from 4 to 2 in header
- **Better constraints**: Ensured all content fits within available space

## Files Modified
- `lib/screens/kyc_verification_screen.dart`

## Testing Results
✅ **App launches successfully** without overflow errors
✅ **Header displays properly** with adequate spacing
✅ **Text content renders correctly** with proper truncation
✅ **Navigation works smoothly** between screens
✅ **No more RenderFlex overflow exceptions**

## Current Status
The KYC verification screen now displays without any layout overflow issues. All text content is properly constrained, and the header layout provides sufficient space for the logo and navigation elements.

The app is ready for production use with a clean, error-free UI experience.

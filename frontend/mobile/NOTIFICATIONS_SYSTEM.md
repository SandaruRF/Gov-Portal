- Local state for notification deletion
- Proper state updates when notifications are removed

### UI Components
- Custom notification cards with proper spacing

### Data Structure
```dart
class NotificationItem {
  final String id;
  final String title;

  final bool isRead;
}
```

### Sample Data
The system includes three sample notifications:
1. "Tax Payment Due" - 2 days ago
2. "Document Ready" - 5 days ago  
3. "License Renewal" - 1 week ago

## Integration Points

### Home Page Integration
- Updated `home_page_signed_in.dart` to navigate to notifications
- Bottom navigation bar "Notification" button now functional

### Route Configuration
```dart
'/notifications': (context) => const NotificationsScreen(),
```

- ✅ View details navigation
- ✅ Delete confirmation modal
- ✅ Notification removal functionality
